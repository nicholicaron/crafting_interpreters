# crafting_interpreters
My Rust port of the interpreters for the Lox language covered in Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" book.

[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) is a simple, dynamically {typed,dispatched}, high level scripting language with C-like syntax, Scheme-like scoping, and garbage collection.
